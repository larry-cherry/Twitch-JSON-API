# Twitch-JSON-API
Front-End Web app that displays a list of my favorite twitch streams and shows if they are live

### Features

* Uses a custome built javascript object for creating channels. 
* Uses Flexbox to help resize the app to better fit mobile devices
* Uses the twitch api to check if streamers are online
